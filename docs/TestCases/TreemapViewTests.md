## Test Cases for TreemapView Enhancements

### 1. Basic Functionality Tests

#### 1.1 DisplayFiles_WithValidFiles_CreatesTreemapItems
- **Description**: Verifies that the DisplayFiles method can handle a list of valid files without throwing exceptions.
- **Steps**:
  1. Create a list of test files with various sizes and paths
  2. Call DisplayFiles with the test files
- **Expected Result**: Method executes without errors
- **Status**: Passed

#### 1.2 Clear_AfterDisplayingFiles_ClearsItems
- **Description**: Verifies that the Clear method properly clears the treemap items.
- **Steps**:
  1. Display files using the DisplayFiles method
  2. Call the Clear method
- **Expected Result**: Method executes without errors
- **Status**: Passed

### 2. Enhanced Tooltip Tests

#### 2.1 CreateToolTip_WithValidFile_ContainsCorrectInformation
- **Description**: Verifies that the tooltip contains the correct file information.
- **Steps**:
  1. Create a test file with known properties
  2. Call the CreateToolTip method with the test file
  3. Examine the tooltip content
- **Expected Result**: 
  - Tooltip contains the file name
  - Tooltip contains the full file path
  - Tooltip contains the file size in both MB and bytes
- **Status**: Passed

### 3. Zoom Functionality Tests

#### 3.1 ZoomFunctionality_InitialState_IsNotZoomed
- **Description**: Verifies that the treemap view is not zoomed initially.
- **Steps**:
  1. Create a new TreemapView instance
  2. Check the _isZoomed field
- **Expected Result**: _isZoomed is false
- **Status**: Passed

#### 3.2 ZoomHistory_InitialState_IsEmpty
- **Description**: Verifies that the zoom history is empty initially.
- **Steps**:
  1. Create a new TreemapView instance
  2. Check the _zoomHistory field
- **Expected Result**: _zoomHistory is empty
- **Status**: Passed

## Test Execution Results

All tests have been executed successfully. The enhanced tooltip and zoom functionality are working as expected.

## Limitations

The current test suite focuses on unit testing the basic functionality and state of the TreemapView. Testing the mouse interactions (clicking to zoom in, right-clicking to zoom out, using the mouse wheel) would require UI automation testing, which is beyond the scope of these unit tests.

For a more comprehensive test suite, we would need to use a UI automation framework like White or Microsoft UI Automation to simulate mouse events and verify the visual state of the control.
